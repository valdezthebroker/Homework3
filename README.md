#Homework3
The password generator homework was not difficult to start because most of the work was already done but it was still overwhelming considering js file required many steps of code. I began using the wrong methods to complete the homework - creating checkboxes rather than prompts. My original version of the homework did not include prompts. The use of curly braces and brackets is becoming easier to implement. I understand the else if statement; however referencing some of the items and finding key words to create functions was confusing. I'm noticing a similar structure with some of the functions and was able to copy and paste the code. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to review the homework with my tutor and hope to go over it on Sunday and resubmit then.
